All code can be found at: https://github.com/lordvon/OpenFOAM_Tutorials/tree/master/DuctedFan

DESCRIPTION:
An actuator disk (pressure-jump baffle) will be used to simulate a propeller. A duct surrounds the actuator disk. The simulation is axisymmetric via the cyclic boundary condition.

OUTLINE:
-Overview of the mesh.
-Overview of the necessary boundary conditions.
-Inspect the velocity and pressure fields.
